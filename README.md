# Hello ‚úåüèª! I'm Zachary Roland

I am proficient in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as the React JS library. On the back end, I‚Äôm familiar with Node.js and Express. I‚Äôve also worked with both SQL and NoSQL database structures, specifically MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I have a background in fashion merchandising, retail, and customer service, and I have just completed the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at Midland Code Academy. While studying at the Midland Code Academy, I learned how to think through logic flows to tackle complex ideas and break them down into actionable steps. I also learned how to apply those logic flows to write effective and well documented code. I have great people skills and an infectious positive attitude. Coupled with my programming abilities, this allows me to work well in a team environment, collaborate, and problem solve to develop a great end product.

I‚Äôm looking for a position as a developer where I can focus on putting my skills into practice, while also learning and developing new skills and languages. I want to utilise javascript libraries like React to make exciting, useful, and beautiful components and applications. I‚Äôm a programmer with excellent communication and problem solving that can effectively be incorporated into a team environment.
