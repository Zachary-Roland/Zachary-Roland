# Hello ‚úåüèª! I'm Zachary Roland

I am a fashion designer turned web developer, and I've been working as a React Developer at Talent Plus since September 2021. I completed Midland Code Academy's Full Stack Development bootcamp in August 2021 after three months of study, an achievement I attribute to my strong commitment to being efficient, disciplined, and organized. While studying at the Midland Code Academy, I learned how to think through logic flows to tackle complex ideas and break them down into actionable steps. I also learned how to apply those logic flows to write effective and well-documented code.

In my role at Talent Plus, I have facilitated purchases through third-party payment integrations, developing an integration with third-party payment systems for consumers to purchase online assessments. I worked on a team to create a modern React-based interviewing application, effectively replacing a decade-old product. Additionally, I have managed client integrations with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), creating and maintaining REST/SOAP APIs for client partners to view talent assessment results with different ATSs.

I have also created custom single-page websites for client partners and established a streamlined request submission system for CSMs. Throughout my time at Talent Plus, I have continuously worked to build out React-based solutions while maintaining and adding new features to legacy Grails applications when necessary.

I am proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and their use with the React.js library. I have experience working in Grails, Node.js, Express, and with both SQL and NoSQL database structures, specifically MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I'm a self-driven performer who feels the need to grow each day, so I love working in a career that requires continued learning and development. With a background in retail and customer service, I've found these soft skills have been integral to my success in a team. I'm an effective communicator, and I naturally keep others on track when expectations change, so projects move forward.
