# Hello ‚úåüèª! I'm Zachary Roland

I am a fashion designer turned web developer, and I‚Äôve been working in my first role as a React Developer at Talent Plus since September of 2021. I completed Midland Code Academy‚Äôs Full Stack Development bootcamp in August of 2021 after three months of study, an achievement I attribute to my strong commitment to being efficient, disciplined, and organized. While studying at the Midland Code Academy, I learned how to think through logic flows to tackle complex ideas and break them down into actionable steps. I also learned how to apply those logic flows to write effective and well documented code. 

In my current role, I‚Äôve enjoyed taking that commitment further, working with my team to solidify our best practices and create code styles. I am proficient in Javascript and Typescript, as well as HTML and CSS, and their use with the React JS library. I have experience working in Grails. On the back end, I‚Äôm familiar with Node.js and Express. I‚Äôve worked with both SQL and NoSQL database structures, specifically MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I‚Äôm a self-driven performer that feels the need to grow each day, so I love working in a career that requires continued learning and development. I have a background in retail and customer service, and I‚Äôve found these soft skills have been integral to my success in a team. I‚Äôm an effective communicator, and I naturally keep others on track when expectations change, so projects move forward.
